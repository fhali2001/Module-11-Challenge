# Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis

## Background
You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

## What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:

### Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

### Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

## Instructions
### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Open the Jupyter Notebook in the starter code folder named part_1_mars_news.ipynb. You will work in this code as you follow the steps below to scrape the Mars News website.

1. Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site.
2. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
3. Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles.
4. Store the scraping results in Python data structures.
5. Print the list in your notebook.

### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
Open the Jupyter Notebook in the starter code folder named part_2_mars_weather.ipynb. You will work in this code as you follow the steps below to scrape and analyze Mars weather data.

1. Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
2. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
3. Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
4. Examine the data types associated with each column.
5. Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer specific questions.
6. Visualize the results using data visualization techniques.
7. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.

## Requirements
### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News (40 points)
- Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup).
- The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted.
- The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structure.

### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data (60 points)
- The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data.
- The data was analyzed to answer specific questions, and data visualization techniques were used to support each answer.
- The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file.

## Grading
This assignment will be evaluated against the requirements and assigned a grade according to the following table:

Grade	Points
A (+/-)	90+
B (+/-)	80–89
C (+/-)	70–79
D (+/-)	60–69
F (+/-)	< 60
